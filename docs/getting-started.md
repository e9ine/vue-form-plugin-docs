## What is vue-form-plugin

vue-form-plugin is a special plugin for Vue, built to spin up quick, comprehensive and dynamic forms without hassle. It ships with certain peer dependencies required to fully utilise the features.

We here, at e9ine, believe Forms are omnipresent and indispensable element of the internet world today. Dynamic Forms let you build the page within no time and only thing you have to setup is your schemas.
The plugin is intelligent enough to track all the props and models, and based on the options it generates the forms.
